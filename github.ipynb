    "\n",
    "Version control is the practice of tracking and organizing (source) code in software engineering.\n",
    "Git is a version control system which automates this process, and GitHub is one of the hosting platforms that uses Git. It allows you to roll back to previous versions of your code, make experimental changes on new branches, merge fixes, and work collaboratively on the same codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only place where you can run all Git commands is via its command line interface, accessed via the `git` package. All commands start with `git`, and you can generate a list of them with descriptions using the `man` (for \"manual\") bash command in your terminal,\n",

    "### 2.1.1 Repositories, cloning and forking\n",
    "\n",
    "On GitHub, your code is organized in structures called _repositories_, which you can think of as separate projects. Within a repository, your code may be organized in a directory structure. It is stored \"in the cloud\", meaning on some server somewhere else.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have several copies of the code that lives on GitHub, e.g. on your personal laptop, on your workstation at the university, etc. We'll call these copies _local_ copies. To get a local copy, you can _fork_ or _clone_ a repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Forking** creates a copy of the repository in that moment and associates the copy with your account. You're then free to develop it however you like, it is your individual copy with no others having access to it. You would typically fork a repository if you \n",
    "- have no write access to it, e.g. it's a large project like SciPy, but you want to contribute, or\n",
    "- you want complete control over your copy of this repository, without other developers having access to your copy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When **cloning** a repository, there is no copy created in your account, just your local machine. The remote (the repository you cloned) remains visible to and editable by everyone who had access to it. You'd do this for\n",
    "- compiling software from source,\n",
    "- working on projects owned by yourself,\n",
    "- working collaboratively on a project with multiple active developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Exercise\n",
    "If you haven't contributed to a repository on GitHub (a \"remote\") yet, you'll need to set up ssh (secure shell protocoll) to communicate with your remote repository. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to generate a new private-public key pair and the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add it to your GitHub account. You'll need to do this on every new machine you try to access your account from. This method of authentication replaced the username-password method a while ago.\n",

    "To clone a remote from the command line, run\n",
    "\n",

    "git init\n",
    "```\n",

    "These three commands created a directory with your chosen repo name, changed diretories into that directory, and then initialized a git repository. Alternatively, the GitHub web interface walks you through creating a repository which you can then clone to your local machine.\n",

    "### 2.1.2 Making progress: add, commit, push\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a local copy is created, GitHub tracks changes to the files within a repository via _commits_. These are incremental changes to source code. \n",
    "\n",
    "All files within your repository start off being untracket by git. You can add them to the version control system like this\n",
